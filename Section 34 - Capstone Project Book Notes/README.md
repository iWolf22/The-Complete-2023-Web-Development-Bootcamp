## Bullet Points


- Programmed a NodeJS and ExpressJS backend API that uses Ajax for asynchronous data transfer and Axios for API calls to the Open Library API to retrieve data on specific books.
- Connected the server backend to PostgreSQL, performing CRUD operations with SQL to permanently save user data.
- Designed a user-friendly frontend that allows users to search for specific books and save them along with their notes using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and EJS once again
