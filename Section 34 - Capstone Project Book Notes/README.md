# BookNotes™

## Description

Ever forget about the books you read? Well, fear no longer as BookNotes™ allows you to easily track and save all the wonderful books you have read, using the power of NodeJS, Express, Axios, and PostgreSQL!
Add a new book to your catalogue by simply searching for it and filling in the prompted information. Happy reading!

## Bullet Points

• Programmed a NodeJS and ExpressJS backend API that uses Ajax for asynchronous data transfer and Axios for API calls to the Open Library API to retrieve data on specific books.
• Connected the server backend to PostgreSQL, performing CRUD operations with SQL to permanently save user data.
• Designed a user-friendly frontend that allows users to search for specific books and save them along with their notes using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and EJS once again
