# Personal-Website-README

This is my personal website I made as an introductory project to using vanilla HTML, CSS and Javascript.
It is currently only configured for devices with a 1080p screen and a 16:9 aspect ratio but it is still usable on other platforms.

Currently, I do have plans on making an improved personal website with more advanced frameworks, like Bootstrap and reactjs.
With the end goal of making a professional and interactive website that will entertain and immerse users.

Currently, if you would like to visit the website, it is available at: https://iwolf22.github.io/Personal-Website/
